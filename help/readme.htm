<p align="left"><b>AlegrDiff </b>compares text and binary files. It allows also
to merge the text differences.</p>
<p align="left">The program allows to compare single files as well as the whole
directory with subdirectories. The differences are shown with different font and
color.</p>
<p align="left">The files are compared either as text or binary.</p>
<p align="left">To compare just two files, select <font face="Microsoft Sans Serif">File/Compare
Files</font> command in the menu, or click <img border="0" src="CompareFiles.png" width="16" height="15">
toolbar button. You will be prompted for the first file, then for the second
file. The file open dialogs have <b>Recent Dirs</b> combobox, which allows you
to jump to one of recent folders you used, and <b>Binary comparision</b>
checkbox:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="OpenFirstFile.png" width="600" height="408"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">To compare directories, select <b>File/Compare Directories... </b>
command in the menu, or click <img border="0" src="CompareDirs.png" width="16" height="15">
toolbar button. In the following dialog you can type in the directory names, or,
by clicking on the [<b>...] </b>buttons, select them from the directory tree, or
select from recently used folders.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="CompareDirsDlg.png" width="420" height="368"></p>
<p align="left">You can specify pattern for the filenames to be included in
comparison, in the <b>Filename filter</b> edit box. You can specify one or a
number of patterns, separated by comma or by semicolon.</p>
<p align="left">By clicking <b>Advanced &gt;&gt; </b>button, you can also
specify some options, normally available in <b>Preferences</b> dialog. These are
filename patterns which are recognized as C/C++ files, filename patterns which
are&nbsp; recognized as binary files, and filename patterns which will be
excluded from compare, and tab indent.</p>
<p align="left">As you click OK, the program compares all the files in the first
directory against the corresponding files in the second directory, and then
shows the comparison report, with <b>File Name</b>, <b>Subdirectory</b>, <b>1st
Modified at</b>, <b>2nd Modified at</b>, <b>Comparison result</b> columns. You
can sort the report or change sorting direction by clicking on the column
header.</p>
<p align="left"><b>File </b>menu and right-click context menu allow also to open
the selected files in the default application registered for the file extension
(equivalent of double-clicking the file in the Windows Explorer), and copy the
selected files to any folder:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="ContextMenu.png" width="413" height="133"></p>
<p align="left">To see the detailed differences between two files, double click
on the difference report line. The program allows to keep several files open.
The file window can be closed by pressing <b>Esc</b> key.</p>
<p align="left">The files will be shown just like in the text editor. The text
which is only in the first or second file is shown with different style and
color. Default for erased text is <font color="#FF0000"><strike>strikethrough,
red</strike></font>, for added text is <font color="#0000FF"><u>underlined, blue</u></font>.
You can change this in the <b>Preferences</b> dialog. You can move to the next
difference by clicking <img border="0" src="NextDiff.png" width="18" height="18">
button, or by pressing <b>F7</b> key. You can move to the previous difference by
clicking <img border="0" src="PrevDifference.png" width="18" height="18">
button, or by pressing <b>Shift+F7</b> key.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="1" src="TextDiff.png" width="584" height="203"></p>
<p align="left">You can use most of standard keyboard and mouse navigation
commands. Mouse wheel is also supported. You can find a selected text or word
under caret by pressing <b>Ctrl+F3</b>, then find the next or previous
occurrence by pressing <b>F3 </b>or <b>Shift+F3</b>. You can select the text and
copy it to the system clipboard.</p>
<p align="left">Toolbar button <img border="0" src="ShowLineNumbers.png" width="25" height="21">
shows line numbers along with the text. Numbers of lines which are present in
both files are shown in black, numbers of first-file-only lines are shown in red
(or whatever color is chosen for the erased text), numbers of second-file-only
lines are shown in blue:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="1" src="TextWithLineNumbers.png" width="608" height="155"></p>
<p align="left">Toolbar button <img border="0" src="IgnoreWhitespaces.png" width="19" height="20">
hides whitespace difference. Not all spaces are ignored, but only those which
don't change the text syntax and meaning. See, for example, the original text:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="1" src="TextWithSpaces.png" width="634" height="324"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">And the text with the extra spaces hidden:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="1" src="TextWithoutSpaces.png" width="632" height="326"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Extra spaces that are erased from the first file are not shown;
extra spaces which are added to the second file are shown, but not marked as
added. Spaces that break some reserved character sequences (+=, -=, and other
C/C++ operators, and also spaces inside character and string constants are not
extraneous, and are shown in the both cases. Of course, the reserved sequences
and constants are recognized only in the files which bear some specific file
name extensions.</p>
<p align="left">The differences can be marked as <b>accepted</b> or <b>declined</b>.
These attributes are used for merging the files. This feature allows to select
only those changes that you like, and create a new file containing only selected
changes. When the difference is marked, it is shown with different background
color. The text that won't go to the merged file is shown with gray background;
the text which goes to the merged file is shown with green background:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="1" src="MergedText.png" width="436" height="133"></p>
<p align="left">These colors can be customized in <b>Preferences </b>dialog.</p>
<p align="left">To <b>accept </b>the difference, set the caret on it and select <b>Merge/Accept</b>
menu command, or click <img border="0" src="AcceptButton.png" width="17" height="17">
toolbar button, or press <b>Shift+F6</b>. To <b>decline</b> the difference, set
the caret on it and select <b>Merge/Decline</b> menu command, or click <img border="0" src="DeclineButton.png" width="18" height="18">
toolbar button, or press <b>F6</b>. You can also do the operation over all the
differences in the selected text area. Text selection is done by the standard
keyboard and mouse means. Accept/Decline commands are also available in the
right-click context menu.</p>
<p align="left">You don't need to mark all changes. The program will ask you
what to do with unmarked ones - either accept or decline them. For example, if
you want to base the merged file on the second one, you just need to decline
some changes, and accept all others, when asked.</p>
<p align="left">To save the merged file, select <b>File/Merge Files And Save...</b>
menu command, or click <img border="0" src="SaveMergedButton.png" width="16" height="16">
toolbar button. You may be asked whether you wish to accept or decline all
unmarked changes. You will then be asked for the file name. The saved resulting
file will be open in the separate window in the program. You can then open it in
the default editor, by selecting <b>File/Open first file </b>command.</p>
